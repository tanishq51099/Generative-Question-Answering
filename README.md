# Generative Question Answering Using RAG
Base Model - T5

Retrieval Model - BM25 (Sparse Retrieval Model) and TF-IDF (Sparse Retrieval Model)

Hybrid Retrieval Model - BGE-M3

The BGE-M3 model incorporates both sparse and dense retrieval methods. Itâ€™s designed to support hybrid retrieval, which combines the strengths of various methods, including dense retrieval like DPR and sparse retrieval like BM25, unicoil, and splade. This allows BGE-M3 to perform embedding and sparse retrieval efficiently, providing token weights similar to BM25 without additional cost when generating dense embeddings. Dense retrieval is used for mapping text into a single embedding vector, which is beneficial for tasks like sentence similarity. Sparse retrieval, on the other hand, calculates a weight only for tokens present in the text, which is typical for models like BM25 that are based on lexical matching.
